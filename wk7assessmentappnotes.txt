function doublerinsert is the more scalable function presented 

function doubleinsert utilizes the unshift method which overwrites the original array and adds new items at the beginning of that array.

function doubler append utilizes the push method which adds new items to the end of the array and changes the length of the array and returns the new length.

between the two functions insert is about x2 as fast (when considering the tiny array) as the append function. It appears that the push method is doing a few extra steps taking up time unnecessarily.where the insert function is merely overwriting an array the append function is adding the items and then returning the new length.
